## ❓ What is a Skin Changer?  
A **League of Legends Skin Changer** is a tool that modifies local game files to display alternate skins for champions. These changes are **only visible to you**, meaning other players see the default skins. It’s a fun way to personalize your gameplay without breaking Riot’s rules.
